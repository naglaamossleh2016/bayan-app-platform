# App Platform (HTML/CSS/JS) — Minimal JS

This is a **UI template** for a server-rendered platform (PHP / .NET).

- No JavaScript fills tables or loads data.
- Only Bootstrap bundle JS is included (modals/collapse).
- Developers will connect forms/tables to the database.

## Pages

- login.html
- index.html
- applications.html
- app-details.html
- design-catalog.html
  -change-password.html

## Assets

- assets/css/style.css (Teal theme + RTL + login background)
- assets/js/site.js

## Backend notes

- Replace placeholders like [UserName], [TotalApps].
- Forms already have action/method; map them to your endpoints.
